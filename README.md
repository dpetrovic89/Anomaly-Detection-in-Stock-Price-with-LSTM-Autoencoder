## What are market anomalies? 

A market anomaly is a price action that contradicts the expected behaviour of the stock market. Some financial anomalies appear only once and disappear, but others appear consistently throughout historical chart analysis. Traders and investors can use these unusual market behaviours to find opportunities throughout the stock market.

A market anomaly refers to the difference in a stockâ€™s performance from its assumed price trajectory, as set out by the efficient market hypothesis (EMH). EMH assumes that share prices reflect all of the information available at any given time. In theory, this should make it impossible to purchase overvalued stocks, or sell a stock above its value, because it would always trade at a fair market price.
